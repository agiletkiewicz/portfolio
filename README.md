## Hey there! 

If you have landed on this page then you are probably interested in my work. Welcome!

This is a "simple" static webpage to share a little about me. What you can tell from this small code sample is:
- How I organize my code
- My creativity with native tools before bringing in frameworks (but frameworks are great too!)
- Demonstration of managing the entire development lifecycle from design to deployment
