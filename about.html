          <p>I am a Software Engineer coming from 10 years in the retail industry. My career is focused on creating outstanding customer experiences and I am excited to continue that with code!<br/><br/>

            I love to work on projects that delight users, positively impacting their everyday lives and the environment around them. I thrive in a collaborative work environment and my teammates would say that I am an innovative and practical problem solver. Personally I love travel and theater, and I have even been known to participate in amateur productions.<br/><br/>
            
            I live in San Francisco with my fiancé and rescue dog. They have both been very supportive in my completion of Flatiron School’s Software Engineering Immersive Program.</p>

              <p>I began my career in retail at TJX first in merchandising (financial and unit planning) and then buying (both private label development and buying brands). My experience was concentrated in new and high-growth departments and seasonal areas. I managed aggressive financial plans, led teams and worked cross-functionally to deliver results.<br/></br>My favorite project was working on an event for outdoor active products. I opened new brands and brought in new product categories such as SUP boards and trampolines for visual impact in-store and an exciting customer experience.</p>

              <p>My interest in sustainability and entrepreneurial spirt led me naturally to join the founding team at <a href="www.silkroll.com">SilkRoll</a>, an online secondhand fashion start-up. There, I managed all merchandising strategy, organic marketing and operations. <br/><br/>My favorite role was working closely with and eventually taking over for the Head of Operations Technology, managing and continuously improving the technology that enabled warehouse operations and therefore a viable business model. This inspired me to pivot into tech more directly.</p>

              <p>At Flatiron School I got my first 1,000 hours of coding training in Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and front-end frameworks React and Redux. Through this program I fell in love with code and learned how to learn new technologies fast.<br/><br/>During my time at Flatiron's self-paced program I hosted study groups, proactively sought fellow students for pair programming and took on a side project creating a custom operations dashboard for SilkRoll.<br/><br/>I am currently expanding my learning with TypeScript and CS fundamentals and am excited to get in my 10,000 hours and beyond!</p>
